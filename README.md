# KAIC
KAIC, or Keep Adversary In Check, is a program with the function of storing and organizing information about stalkers or harassers. 

KAIC, in the current version of ALPHA 0.6.18, is a WIP(Work In Progress) program that is dedicated to helping combat the ever-growing problem of stalkers and those who are harassing the user of this program. The sole intended utility of this program is to collect information about someone stalking or harassing the user of this program, which can then be organized and sent to local law enforcement, or otherwise disseminated. In NO way, is this program intended to be used for illegal data storage, nor is it intended to be used by stalkers. In the future, there will be measures implemented against the wrongful use of this application. 

KAIC is a program of mine that's been in casual development since late April of 2022, and will continue to be supported as long as I am capable of doing so; However, my career and field of work is in Meteorology, not Computer Science. This goes to say, I will not be able to dedicate to this program or the concept of this program as well as others may. I intend for this program to never be sold, and for people to use it in good faith. I hope and happily welcome any positive modifications to the software, and may introduce a sort of modded program browser inside the program in the future, but no modded version will ever be on this GitHub page. 

The only exception to my stance on added a modded version to this page, is if I am unable or unwilling to continue supporting this project, and another individual gives clean code that enhances this program. In the case of my discontinued support, I will allow someone else to take over the KAIC project. 

I would be more than happy to see some modifications to the KAIC application, so long as they are done in good faith. 


# About Me
My name is Ken, and whilst I enjoy and share a great interest in computers, my actual career lies within the realm of Meteorology. Computer Science is merely a hobby I am very active in. Therein lies the reason in which I cannot provide the quality, speed, or continuity that can be expected with experienced Application Developers. Though I cannot perform as well as someone who is more experienced than me, I enjoy the problem solving and function of app development, and I will attempt to give the best, most widely-functional application I can provide. I will not work every day on this project, usually I work for some hours when I can, so I don't burn out. That's the reason that this project has taken so long(and that I got burnt out and didn't return to the project for a month). In addition to coding, I have lots of extra hobbies that take up more of my time such as hiking, biking, camping, exercising, and gaming. Altogether, my hobbies, studies, and lifestyle prohibit me from remaining healthy while committing to something such as this project 24/7. 



Thank you for reading, and thanks for trying out KAIC. I'm very excited to roll it out and update it!
